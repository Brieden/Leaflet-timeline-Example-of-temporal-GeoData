# Leaflet+timeline: Example of temporal GeoData

This is an example of the simple illustration of temporary and geospatial information. It is using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) with the Plugin [timeline](https://github.com/skeate/Leaflet.timeline).
You can see the density of workers around Zurich, based on BfS. The data(GEOJson) was generated using [frictionlessdata-datapackage-pipelines](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-pipelines).


Result: [Work Density Map](https://brieden.github.io/Leaflet-timeline-Example-of-temporal-GeoData/ZH_Work_Density_Chronology.html)
